# Tooltipped

## Development server

### This dev server assumes you have both the latest version of node and npm to be able to run this application locally

### Simply run `npm run installAndDemo` at the root of this repo in your command line to install all necessary dependencies and launch a browser window. Then you can just kick back while your app compiles and is served up at the URL. Voila! Tooltips.

### Alternatively if you already have Angular CLI all set up:
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
